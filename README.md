# End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition
This repository contrains implememtations of end-to-end ASR system by CTC, LAS and transducer.

The code is mainly based on the [course](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/courses.html) and this [implementation](https://github.com/Alexander-H-Liu/End-to-end-ASR-Pytorch).


## To do

0. move feature extraction ops to cuda
1. add Conv1D acoustic feature extractor
2. LSTM down sampling
3. add layer normalization
4. projection layer after each LSTM
